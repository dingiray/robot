# robot

This code for a 4wd raspberry pi robot comes originally from Ingmar Stapel, author og the book "Roboter Autos mit dem Raspberry Pi" from the website http://custom-build-robots.com.

On base of that code i made a couple of extensions, advances features and improvements:

#1: Integration of Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SRF04 instead of Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SRF08 (pretty expensive)
